📚 RAG-based Knowledge Assistant

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) powered assistant that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with a vector database to deliver accurate, context-aware, and domain-specific answers.
This project demonstrates how to build a production-ready AI system that can retrieve knowledge from documents and augment LLM responses with factual grounding.

🚀 Features

🔍 Contextual Retrieval – Uses embeddings + vector database for semantic search.

🧠 LLM Integration – Augments retrieved knowledge with generative AI responses.

📑 Multi-format Support – Load data from PDFs, text files, or web sources.

⚡ Optimized Query Flow – Embedding + retrieval + generation pipeline.

🌐 Extensible – Easy to plug in other models (OpenAI, Hugging Face, etc.).

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python 3.10+

LangChain – Orchestration

Hugging Face Transformers – Embeddings & LLM

FAISS / Pinecone / Weaviate – Vector search

[Streamlit / Flask] – UI (optional)
